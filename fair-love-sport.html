                    <p>A long standing issue in the Olympics, this debate has been going on, and evolved, since the 1988 Seoul Olympics:</p>
                    <p>“As a tennis pro who has competed on the regional level, I have never had to subject myself to this Orwellian inspection, nor contemplate the trauma of being told I am not female. But this is precisely what has happened to other women athletes, despite the fact that gender is far too complex to be evaluated by a laboratory test.”</p>

                    <p>...may now want to portray it, that the XX or the XY is the clear distinction between the men and women. This is scientifically not true anymore, and therefore the two are women and they have the right to participate in the women’s competition.”</p>

                <p>Whether chromosomes should affect the gender ruling for Olympic Athletes seems to be in the rearview, at least for the IOC. Nowadays, they determine a woman competitor via testosterone as follows:</p>
                <p>Olympics test levels of testosterone in serum below 288.5 ng/dL* (10 nmol/L) are required for athletes to be considered women at least as of the latest IOC available report online.</p>
                <p>Here are normal human testosterone levels reported by University of Rochester Medical Center:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>15 to 70 ng/dL for women</li>
                    <li>270 to 1,070 ng/dL for men (depending on age)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>"Peer Reviewed Total Testosterone Report", U. of Rochester 2024</em></p>
                <p>*Unit Conversion Calculated by MM</p>
                <p>Based on this data, it appears IOC screens testosterone, yet allows women to compete with levels reported as normal for men!</p>
                <p>Just a few months prior to the highly controversial conclusion to the match pictured above, another incident occurred a little closer to this publication’s home, in Oregon, USA:</p>
                <p class="video-caption">Women’s High School 200m Final Oregon MM Clip</p>
                <p>This coach, John Parks, has stated he was fired from his coaching league for his stance on LGBTQ+ regarding the winner of the 200 meter State Highschool track</p>
                <p>Whether you agree with this Oregon High School track coach’s stance or not, one thing is for sure: More careful attention ought to be paid toward the decision-making processes of our USA & international athletic committees.</p>
