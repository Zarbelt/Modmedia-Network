                <p>What would you do with $650 million in gold? Just one year before the start of World War II, the United States government held nearly 80% of the world gold supply in Fort Knox, Kentucky. Every dollar was backed by its equivalent fair market value in gold. An Austrian Economist’s dream come true!</p>
                <p>Fast forward to today- inflation is rising after removing the aforementioned gold standard and hard assets like gold & bitcoin have skyrocketed. Kaspa ($KAS) is the world’s premier cryptocurrency, if your criteria for crypto is that it embodies the original Bitcoin white paper’s Proof-of-Work vision. Peer-to-peer electronic cash, right? With US inflation soaring at near record highs, it begs the question- why save in the US Dollar anymore if there’s a viable alternative with higher velocity liquidity?</p>
                <p>Of course, the first counter-argument is usually “Well, are people using it?”. Kaspa is skyrocketing into the top this year, and it hasn’t had a bad month yet. In fact, the dominant trend is it posts a new all-time high each month 2024 chart:</p>
                <p>The year of this article, 2024, Kaspa is starting to hit new all time high prices monthly like clockwork. This trend is continuation from last year, where nearly all twelve months of 2023 Kaspa posted new ATH’s as well.</p>
                <p>Three main criteria that drive currency strength:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Supply rate</strong>- nearing 80% of Kaspa is already in the hands of many of the highly decentralized groups of the various sized holders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demand</strong>- Marathon Digital, Bitcoin mining giant, has been mining Kaspa all year, a clear market indicator for high demand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Liquidity</strong>- Kaspa is ready to become the most liquid currency on earth. Currently almost double the efficiency of Solana, Kaspa plans to 10X transaction speed by 2025. Oh, and did I mention transaction fees on Kaspa are a fraction of a fraction of a cent?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Kaspa achieves all of this with its first mover advantage on the BlockDAG technology sector. It was the first fair launched in 2021 by the Dev team, no CEO’s, no venture capital. In the subsequent time since, 70% of total supply has been mined by home computer GPUs, driving industry leading levels of decentralization of holders.</p>
                <p>Yes, the crypto market will hit new four-year lows in the years to come. The question is, will Kaspa? Sound economics says, maybe not.</p>
