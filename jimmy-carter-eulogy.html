            <h2>In Honor of 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter's Life- and Inauguration Day- Here is a Memorandum on His Life.</h2>
            <p>Jimmy Carter was born & raise to be a Peanut Farmer, in Plains, Georgia October 1st 1924. He was just five years old at the start of the Great Depression. Carter rose in society via the Naval Academy, one of the most exclusive (military) schools in the world today. After graduating, he married Rosalynn Smith, and stayed with her the rest of his life. They had four children together, three sons and a daughter.</p>
            <p>Carter followed his education with service in the United States Navy. He was honorably discharged in October 1953. By 1970, he was elected Governor of Georgia. What a homecoming! Carter was known for his faith as a Christian, his humble upbringings, and his virtuous commitment to 'Americana Ideals' of the time, having been both a farmer and then soldier. It's no wonder he gained notice upon announcing his Presidential run in 1974.</p>
            <p>Carter, much like Trump in some ways, was seen as a 'political outsider'. The pundits and media did not expect him to do well upon forming his campaign, but as history shows, he proved them otherwise. By January 20, 1977 Carter was no longer just an exemplary citizen; he was the President of the United States, having defeated (previously press-favorited) opponent Gerald Ford.</p>
            <p>Carter's Presidential legacy was a mixed one in the minds of many Americans, but he is known for his temperance and wherewithal in withstanding the tough domestic economy and international trade challenges that marred the late 1970's. A fun fact about Mr. Carter- is there's a rumor that upon the 'three letter agencies' informing him of the "true nature of UFOs" Mr. Carter allegedly began to cry from an overwhelming disclosure. Did he take the secret to his grave?</p>
            <p>Like or not his Presidential term, Jimmy Carter's commitment to humanity and positive change cannot be overlooked. Following his presidency, Jimmy Carter dedicated the rest of his life volunteering his time and money toward humanitarian efforts. Carter is arguably most well known in the 21st Century timeline for his many decades swinging hammers and framing homes for the unhoused and unfortunate, via Habitat for Humanity. He is one of the few Presidents to carry his service to his people on even greater after leaving the office, and will go down in history as one of the best human beings to have ever held the office- serving the American public into his 90's, until passing away in 2024 at 100 years old.</p>
            <p class="closing">Thank you for your life and service to We The People, Jimmy Carter. Rest easy.</p>
